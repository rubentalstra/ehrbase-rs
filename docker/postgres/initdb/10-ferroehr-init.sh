# app role:
#   * a LOGIN role (non-superuser) and a database it owns;

#   * the extensions the stack needs, installed here by the superuser
#     (`CREATE EXTENSION` on non-trusted extensions requires superuser — the
#     whole reason this image exists). The app's bootstrap
#     `CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS btree_gist WITH SCHEMA ext` then no-ops.
