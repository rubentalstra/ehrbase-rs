# Operations

Running a clinical data repository in production means more than starting the
binary: the database must be backed up and least-privileged, traffic must be
encrypted, upgrades must be safe while the service stays up, and you need to
see what the system is doing. This chapter is a production checklist (database
roles, TLS, backup and point-in-time recovery, upgrades and migrations,
observability, the health probes, and the management surface) drawn from how
the container image and Helm chart are built to run. The
operator-facing HTTP surfaces have their own page:
[Admin & messaging APIs](operations-admin-apis.md).

## Database roles and least privilege

FerroEHR connects to an **external** PostgreSQL 18: a managed service or an
operator-run cluster, never a chart-side sidecar, because a database holding
PHI must be independently backed up and recoverable. The server carries only a
connection string, ideally sourced from a secret.

The database never runs as a superuser at runtime. Two roles cover
provisioning and migration:

| Role | Purpose | Used by |
|---|---|---|
| owner | owns the database | provisioning only |
| `ferroehr_migrator` | runs the schema migrations; owns the helper functions | the migration step |

and five cover serving, split by **pseudonymisation domain** — the clinical
record, the identity of its subject, and the map between the two:

| Role | Reads and writes | Barred from |
|---|---|---|
| `ferroehr_ehr` | `ehr` + its `cold` archival tier | `demographic`, `cold_demographic`, `linkage` |
| `ferroehr_demographic` | `demographic` + its `cold_demographic` tier | `ehr`, `cold`, `linkage` |
| `ferroehr_ehr_reader` | read-only over `ehr` + `cold` | `demographic`, `cold_demographic`, `linkage` |
| `ferroehr_demographic_reader` | read-only over `demographic` + `cold_demographic` | `ehr`, `cold`, `linkage` |
| `ferroehr_linkage` | `linkage` (the party-to-EHR map) | `ehr`, `cold`, `demographic`, `cold_demographic` |

The migrations create these roles idempotently, apply the per-schema grants,
**and revoke every other domain explicitly in both directions**, and revoke the
ability to create objects in the public schema. All five are `NOINHERIT` and
none is a member of another, so a boundary cannot be crossed by picking up a
membership. GDPR Art. 4(5) defines pseudonymisation as processing where
attribution to a person needs additional information "kept separately and
subject to technical and organisational measures", and Art. 32(1)(a) names it a
security measure for health data
(<https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/reg/2016/679/oj>); EDPB Guidelines 01/2025
require that separation to hold against internal actors, operators with
database access included.

Each serving role holds `SELECT`/`INSERT`/`UPDATE`/`DELETE` on its own domain's
tables and `EXECUTE` on the `ext` helper functions, and nothing else: it is not
a superuser, does not bypass row-level security, and cannot create, alter or
drop a table, index, schema or role. On the audit trail it is narrower still:
it may record an event and stamp it forwarded, and it holds no privilege that
can rewrite or remove one (see [Audit](audit.md)).

### Turning the schema split into a role split

The **schema** separation is unconditional: the server always reads and writes
parties in `demographic`, whatever it authenticates as. The **role** separation
is a deployment choice, and it is one configuration key:

```toml
[db]
url = "postgres://ferroehr_ehr:***@pg:5432/ferroehr"
demographic_url = "postgres://ferroehr_demographic:***@pg:5432/ferroehr"
```

(or `demographic_url_file`, for a mounted secret). With it set the server opens
two pools on two credentials, and a flaw that reaches one of them reaches one
domain. Left unset, both pools share the DSN above and the separation is
schema-only.

Either way the server **refuses to boot** when the grants themselves are wrong:
a self-check enumerates every table, view, sequence and function in each
domain and fails, naming the role and the object, if either runtime role can
read across the boundary. `ferroehr db verify` runs the same check. When the
four roles do not exist at all — the development, compose and test-harness
case, where the migrator holds no `CREATEROLE` — the check passes rather than
inventing a failure.

On Kubernetes the same choice is two chart values, mounted as files the same
way the clinical DSN is, so neither credential enters the pod's environment:

```yaml
database:
  existingSecret: ferroehr-db          # postgres://ferroehr_ehr:…
  demographicExistingSecret: ferroehr-db-demographic   # postgres://ferroehr_demographic:…
```

Leave `demographicExistingSecret` unset and both pools share the clinical DSN,
which is the schema-only posture.

Provisioning the four roles is yours in both cases. The migrations create them
only when the migrator holds `CREATEROLE` and skip them with a `NOTICE`
otherwise, so on a managed database — where the migrator usually does not —
create them before the first deploy:

```sql
CREATE ROLE ferroehr_ehr NOLOGIN NOINHERIT;
CREATE ROLE ferroehr_demographic NOLOGIN NOINHERIT;
CREATE ROLE ferroehr_ehr_reader NOLOGIN NOINHERIT;
CREATE ROLE ferroehr_demographic_reader NOLOGIN NOINHERIT;
```

then give each login role membership of exactly one of them. `ferroehr db
verify` tells you whether the boundary holds afterwards.

The compose stacks create all four and grant both domains to the single dev
login role. That demonstrates the schema separation and exercises the boot
self-check; it is deliberately **not** the credential separation, because one
container with one DSN cannot show that half honestly.

> [!NOTE]
> `ferroehr_app` and `ferroehr_reader` are the previous single-domain pair. They
> still exist and still hold their clinical grants, but a deployment should move
> its runtime DSNs to the domain roles above; they are retired after a
> deprecation release.

Which posture you actually get depends on `db.migrate`, because the server's
embedded migrations are DDL: a self-migrating deployment necessarily runs as a
role that can execute DDL. The single-container quickstart takes that path: its
DSN authenticates as a non-superuser role that owns the database and is a member
of both `ferroehr_migrator` and `ferroehr_app`.

## Applying migrations

`db.migrate` decides who runs the schema:

- **`apply`** (the default): the server applies its embedded migrations at
  boot. This is what makes a fresh checkout and an empty database work with no
  configuration at all, and it is the right choice for development and for
  small single-tenant deployments. The runtime DSN must be a member of
  `ferroehr_migrator`, so the serving process holds DDL rights for its whole
  life. Least isolation.
- **`verify`:** the server issues **no DDL at all**. At boot it checks that the
  database carries exactly this build's migrations and refuses to start
  otherwise, naming the schema and what is wrong with it. The DSN can then be
  `ferroehr_app` only, which is the least-privilege production posture: an
  application-level SQL flaw can then reach rows, never the schema.

Migrations are **append-only**, so upgrading an existing database in place is
the supported path and always has been the one your data takes. A released
migration is never edited: sqlx records a checksum of each applied file and
refuses a database whose recorded checksum no longer matches, so a corrected
schema arrives as a new migration rather than as a change to an old one. A CI
guard fails any pull request that modifies, renames or deletes a migration the
base branch already carries.

With `verify`, something else has to run the migrations first. Use the binary's
own subcommand under the migrator DSN: a CI/CD stage, a one-shot job, or the
Helm chart's `migrations.job.enabled` pre-install/pre-upgrade hook Job, which
Helm waits on so a failed migration fails the release (it takes its own
`migrations.job.existingSecret` holding the migrator DSN, deliberately a
different credential from the runtime one, and rendering fails without it):

```shell
FERROEHR__DB__URL='postgres://ferroehr_migrator:***@pg:5432/ferroehr' \
  ferroehr db migrate     # applies; exits when done
FERROEHR__DB__URL='postgres://ferroehr_app:***@pg:5432/ferroehr' \
  ferroehr db verify      # read-only check; exit 0 iff the schema is current
```

Gate the rollout on the migration step so two server versions never race the
schema. Note the difference in failure shape: a `verify` server refuses to boot
against an unmigrated database (loud, immediate), while an `apply` server that
loses its schema later stays up and reports readiness `DOWN`, the warning
below.

### Recovering a partially wiped database

A wipe that removes *some* of the server's schemas is not a fresh start, and the
server refuses to migrate over one rather than doing something plausible with it.

Almost every object lives in `ehr`, but the cold archival tier lives in its own
`cold` schema, so `DROP SCHEMA ehr CASCADE` (a restore gone wrong, a recreated
volume, a wiped test database) takes the primary tier and the migration
bookkeeping and **leaves the archived clinical rows standing**. On the next boot
you get:

```text
migration: the cold archival tier (schema `cold`) is present but the primary tier
(`ehr.vo_version`) is not: the two are one repository and have been wiped apart.
```

The refusal is deliberate. Those mirror tables were created from the primary
tables as they stood when archiving was set up, so silently adopting a survivor
could leave the archive tier a different shape from the tier it mirrors, and
its rows are clinical content belonging to a repository that no longer exists.
Two remedies, and which one applies is your call, not the server's:

- **The data mattered.** Restore the whole database from backup, both schemas
  together, since they are one repository. Do not try to graft the surviving
  `cold` tables onto a fresh schema; their `ehr`, `contribution` and `audit`
  parents are gone, so they are fragments, not a recoverable archive.
- **The wipe was intended** (a test database, a recreated volume). Then
  `DROP SCHEMA cold CASCADE` and start the server again; it migrates from
  scratch.

The reverse partial wipe (dropping `cold` while `ehr` survives) is not caught at
boot, because the migration bookkeeping still records the archival tier as applied.
It surfaces the first time an archive, restore or whole-repository export runs.
Restore from backup; there is no forward path that invents the archived rows back.

> [!TIP]
> When you wipe a FerroEHR database deliberately, drop the **database**, not a
> schema. `DROP DATABASE` cannot leave half a repository behind, and it is the
> only wipe with no partial-state failure mode.

## TLS and database security

These are database-side settings that belong to whoever provisions PostgreSQL;
the deployment references them but cannot enforce them:

- **TLS in transit.** Require `hostssl` on the server and put
  `?sslmode=verify-full` in the DSN so the client verifies the server
  certificate.
- **pgaudit.** Run pgaudit as the database-layer complement to the openEHR
  audit and the ATNA trail (for example `pgaudit.log = 'ddl, role,
  connection'` globally plus object-level audit on the PHI tables) and ship
  the audit log to an immutable store with long (roughly six-year) retention.
- **Encryption at rest.** Encrypt at the volume or disk layer. Do not encrypt
  the stored clinical JSON with pgcrypto: it would break AQL's ability to
  query inside the data.

## Backup and point-in-time recovery

Enable WAL archiving and point-in-time recovery from day one (pgBackRest or a
managed PITR), because a CDR's data is not reconstructible. Clinical and audit
tables are never `UNLOGGED`. Test your restore, not just your backup.

### Dump each domain separately

A logical backup is where the two pseudonymisation domains are easiest to
re-join by accident. One `pg_dump` of the whole database produces a single file
holding both the pseudonymised clinical record and the identities of its
subjects, and whoever can read that file can re-identify every record in it —
which is the separation the schema split and the database roles exist to
maintain. Dump per schema instead, into targets with different access control:

```bash
# The clinical domain
pg_dump --dbname="$CLINICAL_DSN" --format=custom --no-owner \
  --schema=ehr --schema=cold --schema=ext --schema=audit \
  --file=/backups/clinical/clinical-$(date -u +%Y%m%dT%H%M%SZ).dump

# The identities, into a different directory, owned by a different group
pg_dump --dbname="$DEMOGRAPHIC_DSN" --format=custom --no-owner \
  --schema=demographic --schema=cold_demographic \
  --file=/backups/demographic/demographic-$(date -u +%Y%m%dT%H%M%SZ).dump
```

Both examples ship. In Compose they are the opt-in `backup` profile:

```bash
docker compose --profile backup run --rm ferroehr-backup-clinical
docker compose --profile backup run --rm ferroehr-backup-demographic
```

Set `FERROEHR_BACKUP_CLINICAL_DIR` and `FERROEHR_BACKUP_DEMOGRAPHIC_DIR` to the
two targets; they default to `./backups/clinical` and `./backups/demographic`.
Run it as yourself — `FERROEHR_BACKUP_USER="$(id -u):$(id -g)"` — and the dump
lands owned by you. Left unset, the job runs as root inside the container and
keeps one capability, `DAC_OVERRIDE`, because that is what writing a directory
it does not own actually requires: the container drops every other capability,
and without this one uid 0 is just another user against your directory's
permission bits. Everything else stays off — no privilege escalation, read-only
root filesystem.
Under Kubernetes the chart renders one `CronJob` per domain — see the chart's
`backup` values.

> [!WARNING]
> **A backup credential needs `BYPASSRLS`, and the application role does not

Two further properties are yours to arrange, because no configuration file can
enforce them: the two targets carry **different** access control, and the
credential each job uses reaches **one** domain. Give the demographic job the demographic
DSN once you run two ([Deploying](installation/kubernetes.md)); with a single
credential you have separated the artefacts but not the authority to produce
them.

> [!NOTE]
> Point-in-time recovery stays instance-wide. Both domains live in one cluster,
> so a WAL archive covers them together and a recovery target restores them
> together. The separation this section is about is the logical dump.

### Restoring

A restore is not finished when `pg_restore` exits. The grants are the
boundary — a database whose roles came back wrong is a database where the
clinical role can read the identities — so re-apply the role grants before the
server starts, then let the server check them:

```bash
createdb ferroehr_restored
pg_restore --dbname=ferroehr_restored --no-owner clinical-….dump
pg_restore --dbname=ferroehr_restored --no-owner demographic-….dump
# then, before anything serves traffic:
ferroehr db verify
```

`ferroehr db verify` issues no DDL. It checks that the database carries exactly
this build's migrations and that no runtime role can read across the domain
boundary, exiting non-zero when either is untrue — the same check the server
runs at boot, which is why a server pointed at a badly restored database
refuses to start rather than serving from it.

Restoring only one domain is a supported outcome, not a mistake: a demographic
dump restored on its own gives a database with identities and no clinical
record, which is what a rehearsal of the identity domain's recovery looks like.

## Rotating the national-identifier key

Only relevant when `[demographic.identifier_protection]` is on. With it on, a
national identifier of a configured scheme never sits in the versioned body:
the value lives in `demographic.national_identifier`, sealed with AES-256-GCM
under a key derived per tenant from your root key, with an HMAC-SHA-256 digest
beside it so an identifier can be looked up without decrypting anything.

**The root key is load-bearing.** Lose it and the sealed identifiers cannot be
read back by anything, including you. Hold it the way you hold the database
credentials: in your secret manager, injected as `key_file`, never in the TOML
you commit.

Rotation re-encrypts; it is not an edit. Both keys have to be present while it
runs, because every row is opened under the old key and sealed under the new
one, and the lookup digest changes with the key too — so the rotation rewrites
the digest column and every stored reference keeps pointing at the same row.

The procedure:

1. Generate the new key: `openssl rand -hex 32`, or any source of 32 random
   bytes rendered as hex.
2. Take a backup and verify it restores. A rotation rewrites every row in the
   table; a half-finished one you cannot roll back is the failure mode here.
3. Stop writes to the demographic domain, or accept that identifiers written
   during the rotation are sealed under whichever key that write saw. A short
   maintenance window is simpler than reasoning about the alternative.
4. Run the rotation under the migrator role, which is the only identity with
   rights on the whole table.
5. Swap `key_file` to the new key and restart. Verify by resolving one known
   identifier and reading one party back.
6. Destroy the old key once step 5 is verified, not before.

> [!WARNING]
> There is no automated rotation command yet. Until there is, the rotation is a
> scripted job you run against the demographic database with both keys

> of a command as a reason to rehearse the rotation on a copy first.

A per-tenant key is derived from the root key rather than stored, so adding a
tenant needs no key management, and rotating the root rotates every tenant's
subkeys together. The pseudonymisation domain is part of that derivation too:
a subkey derived for the clinical domain opens nothing in the demographic one,
so the per-schema backups above are separate artefacts under separate keys even
where one root key is configured.

## The container image and pod hardening

The published image is distroless and non-root (shell-less, with no package
manager) and is multi-architecture (amd64 and arm64) on GHCR. It is not a
static binary: the server links glibc and `libgcc_s` dynamically, which is why
the base image is the `cc` distroless variant rather than the smaller one, and
why the runtime needs no OpenSSL, no JVM and nothing else from a package
manager.

Under Kubernetes the pod runs the Kubernetes `restricted` profile: non-root
uid/gid 65532, read-only root filesystem with one writable `/tmp`, no
privilege escalation, an empty capability bounding set, `RuntimeDefault`
seccomp, and no service-account token (the workload never calls the Kubernetes
API). The chart's own gates assert that per container on every render, and the
posture read back from a running container, plus the two things the chart
cannot do for you (applying the namespace enforcement label, and narrowing the
NetworkPolicy's ingress sources: the shipped policy narrows the *ports* and,
until you set `networkPolicy.ingressFrom`, admits every source on them; set
`networkPolicy.ingressAllowAll: false`, and `viewer.networkPolicy.ingressAllowAll`
for the viewer, to have that state refused at render instead), are covered in
[Installation → The workload: security context & admission](installation/hardening-workload.md)
and [Namespaces, network & policy →
Ingress](installation/hardening-network-policy.md#ingress-ports-are-narrowed-sources-are-yours).

The Compose path carries a comparable floor, and one guard keeps it:
`scripts/checks/compose-hardening.sh` runs over every committed compose
artifact and fails on a service definition without `cap_drop: [ALL]` and
`no-new-privileges:true`, on any `privileged: true`, on a `seccomp=unconfined`
or `apparmor=unconfined` override, on a mounted Docker daemon socket, and on a
published port that names no host address. The compose files go further than
the guard checks (capabilities are added back one at a time only where an
entrypoint provably needs them, file-descriptor limits are bounded, ports
default to the loopback interface, and most services run a read-only root
filesystem) but those extras are conventions, not enforced properties, so
check them when you adapt a file.

Two services in the quickstart file deliberately do not run read-only, and each
says why in place. The S3 gateway writes its volume store; the server cannot,
because Compose refuses an inline `config` in a read-only service and that
inline config is what makes the file standalone. A deployment that mounts its
configuration from a file instead can add `read_only: true` and a tmpfs at
`/tmp`.

### What the host owes, and we cannot enforce

Four controls belong to whoever runs the daemon. They are stated here because a
container hardening story that ignores them is misleading: the strongest pod
security context in the world sits on top of these.

**Keep the host kernel and Docker Engine current.** A container is a kernel
namespace, not a virtual machine: a kernel privilege-escalation bug is a container
escape, and every runtime hardening above assumes the kernel enforcing it is
patched. Track your distribution's kernel updates and the Docker Engine release
notes with the same urgency you would give a public-facing service.

**Prefer rootless mode.** Running the daemon as a non-root user means a container
escape lands as an unprivileged user rather than as root on the host
(<https://docs.docker.com/engine/security/rootless/>). The images here need no
privileged operation, no host networking, and no daemon socket, so nothing in this
deployment prevents rootless: the constraints are usually the host's (cgroup v2,
`newuidmap`/`newgidmap`, and no privileged ports below 1024, which is why the
server binds 8080 rather than 80).

**Set the daemon log level to `info` (the default) and keep it.** Docker's `debug`
level records request payloads and can put secret material into daemon logs, which
are typically world-readable to anyone with host log access and are shipped
wholesale to log aggregators.

**Control who can pull and push your images.** GHCR access is the deployment's
authorization boundary for what runs in production: whoever can push a tag your
manifests reference can run their code with your database credentials. Restrict
push rights, prefer digest pins over mutable tags for anything you deploy (the
compose files pin the third-party images by digest for exactly this reason), and
verify the published attestations before rollout; the verification command is in
[Installation → Kubernetes & Helm](installation/kubernetes.md).

None of these four is something this project can assert on your behalf, which is
why they are written as your checklist rather than as our claim.

## Upgrades

- **The schema is still greenfield: a release may change the migration
  files, and a database created by an earlier release is then recreated, not
  upgraded in place.** The server records the checksum of every applied
  migration and refuses to start against a database whose recorded checksums
  differ from the files it carries (`migration 1 was previously applied but
  has been modified`). Until the project declares the schema stable, treat a
  version change as "recreate the database and reload the data": drop the
  `ehr`, `ext`, `audit` and `cold` schemas (or the database) and let the new
  version boot. The 4.0.18 release changed every migration file this way (a
  licence header was added to each). Once stability is declared, migrations
  become append-only and a rolling upgrade must stay compatible with the
  _previous_ schema for the window where both versions run: additive changes
  first, destructive changes a release later.
- **Bound the DDL yourself.** Every pooled connection carries the
  `db.statement_timeout_ms` value (60 seconds by default), and the migration
  step runs on that pool, so a runaway statement is cut off, but there is **no
  `lock_timeout`**, so a migration that waits behind a long transaction waits
  as long as that transaction lasts. On a busy table use
  `CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY`, add constraints `NOT VALID` and `VALIDATE`
  later, and set `lock_timeout` in the migration session (or on the migrator
  role) if you need the wait bounded.
- **Pin the image.** Deploy an immutable tag or, better, a `@sha256` digest,
  never `latest`; roll back by re-pinning the prior digest, since the schema's
  backward compatibility makes that safe.
- **Stay available.** Keep at least two replicas (or autoscaling) and a pod
  disruption budget so node drains and upgrades never fully interrupt the
  API. The default 30-second termination grace period covers the server's
  short shutdown drain of the audit and event outboxes.

### How long the version you pinned is supported

Plan the upgrade cadence around this, because it is short and it is deliberate:

- **Only the most recent release receives security fixes.** There are no
  maintenance branches, no long-term-support line, and no backports. A version
  stops receiving fixes the moment a newer release exists.
- **A fix normally arrives as the next patch** on the current minor, so taking
  it does not oblige you to take new behaviour, but that is the usual case,
  not a promise. Where a fix is only correct alongside a behavioural change,
  the release carrying it carries the change, and the changelog entry says so.
- **A published release is never repaired in place.** Release immutability
  means the assets and the tag of a published release cannot be modified at
  all, so the remedy for any defect is a new version.
- **The Helm chart and the published crates follow their own version lines**,
  each supported at its newest published version only. A chart-only fix ships
  as a new chart version between server releases.

The consequence for change control: budget for taking every release, or budget
for maintaining a fork. There is no third option, and the full policy (with
the reasoning and what to do if you need something stronger) is
[SECURITY.md](https://github.com/rubentalstra/FerroEHR/blob/main/SECURITY.md#supported-versions).

## Observability

`tracing` is the single instrumentation API. From it, three signal families
fan out, and **identified data never enters any of them**: telemetry uses
only closed-set labels and opaque request/trace ids, so correlation to a
patient is possible only through the [audit trail](audit.md).

- **Logs** go to stdout (JSON when not attached to a terminal, pretty on a
  TTY) each line stamped with the trace and span id. Shipping and rotation
  are the platform's job. `FERROEHR__LOG__FORMAT` (`auto`/`json`/`pretty`) and
  `FERROEHR__LOG__FILTER` (or `RUST_LOG`, default `info,ferroehr=info`) control
  them, and the level can be changed at runtime through the `loggers` endpoint
  below. On boot the server prints a one-time ASCII banner (version, maintainer,
  project URL, and spec pins) to stdout ahead of the logs; it is suppressed
  under `FERROEHR__LOG__FORMAT=json` so machine log consumers see only structured
  lines.
- **Traces** export to any OpenTelemetry collector (Tempo, Jaeger, and so on)
  over OTLP, but only when you configure an endpoint; with none set, the
  tracing layer is not installed at all (zero overhead). Root spans are named
  by route template, never by a path containing ids.
- **Metrics** come from **one** OpenTelemetry meter provider with up to two
  readers: a Prometheus reader behind `/management/prometheus`, and (when
  `telemetry.metrics_push` is on) a periodic OTLP reader. Every instrument
  reaches both by construction, so a family can never exist on the scrape
  surface and be missing from the push. The catalogue covers HTTP request
  duration, active requests and body sizes; authentication failures and
  authorization decisions (Cedar and remote-PDP); database pool state,
  acquire latency and transaction counts; AQL query counts, latency and plan-
  cache events; compositions committed (by openEHR audit change type);
  validation failures and version-signature faults; WebTemplate cache events;
  events published; the whole ATNA audit pipeline; Tokio runtime gauges;
  process start time; and the `ferroehr_build_info` identity.

  Instrument names carry **no** `_total` suffix and no unit suffix: units are
  declared on the instrument and the Prometheus exporter derives
  `_total`/`_seconds`/`_bytes` itself. Read the exposition to learn the exact
  rendered names rather than assuming either spelling.

The telemetry environment variables:

| Environment variable | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `FERROEHR__TELEMETRY__OTLP_ENDPOINT` | unset (layer not installed) | OTLP collector endpoint |
| `FERROEHR__TELEMETRY__SERVICE_NAME` | `ferroehr` | reported service name |
| `FERROEHR__TELEMETRY__ENVIRONMENT` | `dev` | reported deployment environment |
| `FERROEHR__TELEMETRY__TRACES_SAMPLE_RATIO` | `1.0` | head sampling ratio (start at `0.1` in production) |
| `FERROEHR__TELEMETRY__METRICS_PUSH` | `false` | add the periodic OTLP metrics reader beside the Prometheus one |
| `FERROEHR__TELEMETRY__FLAME_FILE` | unset (layer not installed) | write folded span-timing samples to this file for offline rendering, diagnostic sessions only |

Neither reader is reachable until you say so: the Prometheus surface needs
`management.enabled` plus an access level on the `prometheus` endpoint (see
[the management surface](#the-management-surface)), and the OTLP reader needs
both `otlp_endpoint` and `metrics_push`. A server with neither still records
every instrument; nothing exports it.

> [!TIP]
> A single-container dev stack (`grafana/otel-lgtm`, bundling an OTLP
> collector, Prometheus, Tempo, Grafana, and Loki) ships as a Compose overlay,
> together with a provisioned Grafana dashboard (request rate/errors/duration,
> database pool, AQL latency, validation failures, audit health) and a starter
> alert pack; point the server at it with the two OTLP variables above.

**On Kubernetes**, the same keys arrive through the chart's `config`
passthrough, and the metrics half has a second switch that is easy to miss:

```yaml
# values.yaml
config:
  telemetry:
    otlp_endpoint: http://otel-collector.observability:4317
    environment: production
    traces_sample_ratio: 0.1
    metrics_push: true
  management:
    enabled: true
    endpoints:
      prometheus: admin_only   # the scrape endpoint is off until you name it
metrics:
  enabled: true                # adds the prometheus.io/* pod annotations
  serviceMonitor:
    enabled: false             # or true, with the Prometheus Operator CRDs installed
```

`metrics.enabled` only adds the scrape **annotations**; the endpoint itself is
opened by `config.management.endpoints.prometheus`. Both are needed for an
annotation-discovering Prometheus, and neither is needed if you push over OTLP
instead. **To turn telemetry off**, drop `otlp_endpoint`; the tracing layer is
not installed at all when it is unset.

**The default dashboard.** The "FerroEHR — service overview" Grafana
dashboard (request rate/errors/latency, AQL rate and phase latency,
plan-cache hit ratio, database pool, Tokio runtime, audit throughput — every
query written against the served metric names) reaches Grafana three ways:

- **Compose**: the observability overlay provisions it automatically;
  nothing to do.
- **Kubernetes**: set `metrics.grafanaDashboard.enabled: true` and the chart
  ships it as a ConfigMap labelled `grafana_dashboard: "1"`, which the
  Grafana Helm chart's dashboard sidecar (kube-prometheus-stack includes it)
  discovers and imports. The sidecar watches its own release namespace by
  default — install FerroEHR there, or widen the sidecar's
  `searchNamespace`. `metrics.grafanaDashboard.folder` sets the
  `grafana_folder` annotation for sidecars with folder routing configured.
- **Anywhere else**: import
  `deploy/helm/ferroehr/files/dashboards/ferroehr-overview.json` by hand
  (Grafana → Dashboards → Import).

> [!WARNING]
> With the chart's default-deny egress policy on, add the collector to
> `networkPolicy.egress.rules` (port 4317). An OTLP exporter that cannot reach
> its collector fails **silently**: no traces, no error.

## The admin and messaging APIs

Two operator-facing HTTP surfaces have a page of their own, because each route
carries its own switch, authorization class and status-code contract:

- **The admin API** (`{base}/admin/…`, off by default): physical deletion, the
  activity report, archiving to the cold tier, and whole-repository dump and
  load.
- **The messaging API** (`{base}/message/…`, always mounted): EHR Extract
  export and import, and Template Data Document import.

The full reference is [Admin & messaging APIs](operations-admin-apis.md).

> [!WARNING]
> Enabling the admin API puts irreversible, whole-repository operations on the
> wire: `DELETE {base}/admin/ehr/all` with no parameter empties the
> repository. Keep it off unless a workflow needs it, turn RBAC on, and gate
> the admin role tightly.



## Health probes

The health endpoints are **always served, on the main API port, without
authentication**. There is nothing to enable and nothing to remember: they are
mounted outside the API's authentication and overload-shedding layers, so an
orchestrator can probe a server whose management surface, admin API, and every
optional integration are switched off, and a saturated server still answers
its own probes.

### Choosing a health endpoint

| Endpoint | Contract | Use it for |
|---|---|---|
| `GET /health` | constant `200 OK` (plain text `OK`), touches nothing | load balancers, `docker` `HEALTHCHECK`, anything that must never be auth-gated |
| `GET /health/liveness` | identical to `/health`, the same constant answer under the orchestrator-conventional path | Kubernetes `livenessProbe` and `startupProbe` |
| `GET /health/readiness` | `200` when the aggregate is up or degraded, `503` when a **required** component is down; JSON body with every indicator, each bounded to one second | Kubernetes `readinessProbe`, ops dashboards |
| `GET /ferroehr/rest/status` | product status document: `status`, `server_version`, `openehr_rest_api_version`, `timestamp` | version/identity checks; the URL the container's `ferroehr healthcheck` subcommand probes |
| `GET /management/*` | ops introspection; see below | operators, off by default, enable deliberately |

There is exactly one health surface: the `/health` family above. `/health` and
`/health/liveness` are two conventional names for the same constant answer (a
load balancer wants the bare path, an orchestrator wants the `liveness`/
`readiness` pair); `/ferroehr/rest/status` is a different contract, and no health
endpoint exists under the REST root.

Not every indicator blocks readiness, and the distinction is deliberate:

| Indicator | Checks | Blocks readiness |
|---|---|---|
| `db` | a pooled connection answers | yes |
| `migrations` | this build's schema is present, re-tested on every probe | yes |
| `audit_sender` | whether ATNA forwarding is enabled | no: reports `DEGRADED`, never `503` |
| `events` | the event publisher's broker delivery (present only when eventing is enabled) | no: reports `DEGRADED`, never `503`, since the outbox buffers while the broker is down |
| `fhir_outbound` | the FHIR outbound emitter's broker delivery (present only when the emitter is enabled) | no: reports `DEGRADED`, never `503`, since unemitted rows are retained and re-emitted |

An instance whose event broker is unreachable therefore keeps taking traffic
and says so in the body; an instance that cannot reach its database, or whose
database lost the schema, leaves rotation. The `detail` strings are written to
carry no connection information (no DSN host, database name or role) because
this surface is unauthenticated by design.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Liveness and readiness are deliberately different: liveness never touches a
> dependency, so a database outage takes the instance out of rotation
> (readiness `503`) instead of getting the container killed and restarted in a
> loop. Wire `livenessProbe` and `startupProbe` to `/health/liveness` and
> `readinessProbe` to `/health/readiness`. The Helm chart does exactly this out
> of the box, and only the timings are tunable (`probes.liveness`,
> `probes.readiness`, `probes.startup`); there is deliberately no option to
> point the probes at the container's `ferroehr healthcheck` subcommand
> instead, because that subcommand probes the status document rather than a
> health endpoint, which would leave readiness never touching the database.

## The management surface

The management surface is **ops introspection only**: build info, Prometheus,
the metric views, the effective configuration, and runtime log control. It is
**off by default** on the bare binary, and each endpoint is independently
opt-in with an access level (`admin_only`, `private`, or `public`). It can be
bound to its own internal port so it never appears on the public API listener.
Keeping it off costs you nothing operationally: the health probes above do not
depend on it.

| Environment variable | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `FERROEHR__MANAGEMENT__ENABLED` | `false` | enable the management surface |
| `FERROEHR__MANAGEMENT__BASE_PATH` | `/management` | base path for the surface |
| `FERROEHR__MANAGEMENT__PORT` | unset (main listener) | serve management on its own port |
| `FERROEHR__MANAGEMENT__ENDPOINTS__<NAME>` | `off` | the access level for ONE endpoint: `off`, `private`, `admin_only` or `public`. There is no global default beside it: an endpoint you do not name is not mounted and answers `404`. |

The ops endpoints:

Every one of them ships `off`: nothing is mounted until you name the endpoint
and the level it should answer at. The right-hand column is the level to choose,
not a default you already have.

| Endpoint | Endpoint name to set | Purpose | Level to give it |
|---|---|---|---|
| `GET /management/info` | `info` | product name and version, build SHA, build date, `rustc`, the active `spec_profile`, the openEHR specification versions that profile selects, and the PostgreSQL target | `admin_only` |
| `GET /management/prometheus` | `prometheus` | Prometheus text exposition | `admin_only`, or `public` only when the port is not reachable outside the cluster; a `public` endpoint is served OUTSIDE authentication |
| `GET /management/metrics` | `metrics` | JSON list of the registered metric names | `admin_only` |
| `GET /management/metrics/{name}` | `metrics` | the current value(s) of one metric; `404` for a name that is not registered | `admin_only` |
| `GET /management/env` | `env` | effective configuration, with secrets redacted | `admin_only` |
| `GET`/`POST`/`DELETE` `/management/loggers` | `loggers` | read and change the log level at runtime | `admin_only` |
| `GET /management/flamegraph` | `flamegraph` | on-demand CPU flamegraph of the running server | `admin_only` |

Paths above show the default `management.base_path`; change it and every path
moves with it. The `metrics` name covers both metric routes, and the
`prometheus`, `metrics` and `loggers` routes additionally need their backing
machinery present; without it they are simply not mounted, which is the same
`404` as leaving them `off`.

> [!WARNING]
> `/management/env` and `/management/loggers` expose and change server
> internals; keep them `admin_only`, and prefer binding the surface to an
> internal-only port.

### Profiling: the on-demand CPU flamegraph

When the server is measurably slow, the metrics tell you *how slow*;
`/management/flamegraph` tells you **where the time goes**. The endpoint samples the
whole process with an in-process sampling profiler (the
[`pprof`](https://docs.rs/pprof/latest/pprof/) crate) for a bounded window and
answers with a rendered flamegraph SVG; open it in a browser and read the wide
frames.

```bash
# sample 10 s at 99 Hz (the defaults) and open the result
curl -u admin:… -o flamegraph.svg \
  "http://cdr.internal:9100/management/flamegraph?seconds=10&frequency=99"
```

- `seconds` (default 10) and `frequency` (default 99 Hz) are capped by
  `management.profiling.max_seconds` and `max_frequency` (30 and 999 out of the
  box); a request beyond a cap is refused with `400`, never silently clamped.
- **One sample window at a time**: a second request while one runs answers
  `409`; retry when the window completes.
- Sampling is low-overhead but not free; profile under the real load you are
  diagnosing, and keep the endpoint `admin_only` on an internal port like the
  rest of the surface.
- Best results come from the container images and release builds, which keep
  line tables (`debug = "line-tables-only"`) so frames resolve to `file:line`.

With the surface enabled, the viewer grows an **Operations** screen over
it (dependency health, build provenance, the metric registry, and runtime log
control) which appears only while the CDR serves `/management/info`. See
[Viewer → Operations panel](viewer/operations.md).
