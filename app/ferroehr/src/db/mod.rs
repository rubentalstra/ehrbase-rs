//! `PostgreSQL` bootstrap: connection settings, pool construction, and the
//! per-schema migration sequence.
//!
//! No openEHR spec governs the persistence mechanism; the storage substrate is
//! our own PG18-native design. This module is the single place the rest of the
//! crate obtains a database handle: [`DbConfig`] (the `[db]` config section)
//! feeds [`connect`] and [`connect_tenant_scoped`] for the clinical domain and
//! [`connect_demographic`] / [`connect_tenant_scoped_demographic`] for the
//! demographic one, and [`run_migrations`] bootstraps every schema and
//! applies every embedded migration set. The two served domains differ only in
//! the `search_path` their connections carry, so one set of storage functions
//! serves both; the `linkage` schema is migrated beside them and has no pool
//! of its own. [`verify_domain_isolation`] is the boot gate that refuses to
//! serve when the runtime roles can read across those boundaries. The `sea-query`
//! identifier vocabulary for the live schema lives in [`iden`]. This is the
//! defining module for the whole bootstrap surface, with no re-exports.
